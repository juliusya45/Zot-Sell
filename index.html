        <!-- Integrating HTML, CSS and JS -->
        <!-- 
            This chunk of the site uses HTML, CSS and JS. If you look in script.js,
            you can see how you can use JS to select elements from the HTML document.
            If you look in styles.css, you can see how you can use CSS to style elements
            in the HTML document.
            By using the ids of each of the elements, both the JS and CSS files are able to
            extract and modify the elements without having to do so in index.html. Otherwise,
            if everything is in one file, the code will look extremely messy!
            Here, we have a greeting initially called "Hello, world". However, using JS, you can
            change the greeting to a custom input by clicking the button.
        -->
        <h1 id="greeting">Hello, world!</h1>
        <div>
            <div>
                <label for="exampleFormControlInput1" class="form-label">What is your name?</label>

        <!-- Texts in HTML -->
        <!-- 
            There are diffent types of text elements, but the most common ones are header, paragraph, and anchor elements.
            Headers go from h1 to h6, paragraph elements (p) are simply normal text, and anchor elements (a) are links
            that can wrap around other elements (text and images) and link to another site using the href attribute.
        -->
        <div class="text">
            <h1>Let's take a look at some simple texts. This is an example of a header.</h1>
            <h2>This is a subheader.</h2>
            <h3>This is a subsubheader and this repeats until h6.</h3>
            <p>
                And now this is a regular paragraph text. You type your paragraphs, essays, descriptions,
                all the other nice stuff here. 
                Ooh look a <a href="https://youtu.be/grd-K33tOSM">link</a>

            <p>
                Notice how this entire section has a violet-ish background,
                and all the text in it is white. This is what happens if you apply a CSS style to a class.
                But what if you want all h4 elements in this class to have a certain different style?
            </p>
            <h4>Now you can if you target the h4 within a class. So the style applies here.</h4>
        </div>
        <h4>But not here, even though they're both h4 headers.</h4>
        
        <!-- Lists in HTML -->
        <!-- 
            There are two types of lists, unordered (ul) and ordered (ol). Unordered lists have list
            items (li) without any specific order given to them like bullet points, whereas ordered lists
            have their list items ordered/numbered.

            <h2>Lists</h2>
            <p>
                There are two types of lists, unordered (ul) and ordered (ol). Both list elements containts list items (li).
                However, the difference between the two is that unordered lists do not number/label the elements, and simply
                list them as bullet points, while ordered lists do number/label them.

            and the table data cells (td) would be where you fill in the information.

        <!-- The Box Model -->
        <!-- 
            This is an interactive playground for you to have fun with CSS's box model (although you 
            can mess with everything here, its just a starter-pack after all). 

            Below you can find a new element, the image element (img), which in its bare-form
            takes in the src, which is the link to the image, and the alt, alternative text if the 
            image fails to load. It is good practice for all img elements to have an alt.

        <p>
            Many people who start working in CSS struggle with the differences between
            padding, border and margin. Instead of explaining through words (boring!),
            here is a play space to mess around with them and see what happens.
            Go ahead to styles.css and change some of the values and see what happens.
